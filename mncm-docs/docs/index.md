# Mobile Network Capacity Model

## Background

The Mobile Network Capacity Model is a tool that allows for the calculation of available throughput within a 4G mobile network service area and indicates whether this throughput is sufficient to connect a point of interest (POI: hospital, school, house, etc.) to the internet by comparing the available throughput with the POI's requirements.
