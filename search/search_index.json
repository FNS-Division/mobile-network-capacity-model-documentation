Resource Blocks Requirement Calculation ( poiddatareq ) The poiddatareq method is designed to calculate the number of resource blocks (RBs) necessary to meet a specific download throughput target at a certain distance from a cell site. This method is integral to network capacity analysis as it helps determine if a cell site can provide the required service level at varying distances. The method proceeds as follows: It first checks whether the provided distance exceeds the maximum coverage radius of the cell site. If it does, the method concludes that the download throughput target cannot be met at that distance, and an infinite number of RBs are theoretically required. If the distance is within the acceptable range, the method searches for the closest higher distance value in the preloaded bwdistance_km dataset to identify the corresponding achievable downlink bitrate from the bwdlachievbr dataset for the given bandwidth. The method then calculates the required number of RBs by dividing the download throughput target (converted to kbps) by the achievable bitrate per RB (accounting for the average number of RBs available for PDSCH). The calculated number of required RBs is stored in the rbdlthtarg_result attribute for later reference. This method is vital for assessing the coverage and capacity limitations of a cell site and is instrumental in network planning and optimization efforts. 2. Bitrate Per Resource Block Calculation ( brrbpopcd ) The brrbpopcd method calculates the bitrate available per resource block at a specified population center distance. This is a key performance indicator that reflects how the network's capacity is distributed spatially. The method involves the following steps: Utilizing two preloaded datasets, bwdistance_km and bwdlachievbr , which contain information on distance samples for different bandwidths and their corresponding achievable downlink bitrates, the method identifies the closest distance value that exceeds the given population center distance. It retrieves the achievable bitrate associated with that distance for the specified bandwidth. The method then divides the retrieved achievable bitrate by the average number of resource blocks available for PDSCH to determine the bitrate per resource block at the population center distance. The result of this calculation is stored in the brrbpopcd_result attribute for subsequent use. This method is crucial for network performance analysis as it helps to gauge the efficiency of resource block usage in relation to the distance from the cell site, directly impacting the user experience. 3. Average User Bitrate in Non-Busy Hour Calculation ( avubrnonbh ) The avubrnonbh method computes the average bitrate experienced by a user during non-busy hours, providing an estimate of network capacity when it is not heavily loaded. The calculation is based on user data consumption patterns and considers the following parameters: The average user data traffic volume per month ( udatavmonth ) expressed in gigabytes. The percentage of network usage that occurs during non-busy hours ( nonbhu ). The method carries out a sequence of operations to transform the monthly data volume into an hourly rate, adjusting for the percentage of usage during non-busy hours, and converting the final figure into kilobits per second. The formula takes into account the average number of days in a month, the number of non-busy hours per day, and the conversion factors between gigabytes and kilobits. The calculated average user bitrate for non-busy hours is then stored in the avubrnonbh_result attribute. This metric is of significant value for network operators to ensure that their networks are equipped to handle user demands during off-peak times, which is essential for maintaining a high quality of service.

To delve into how this tool operates, it's important to understand the intricate structure of the LTE channel and some underlying principles of radiocommunications described below. The LTE channel is organized in a complex structure that consists of different elements, such as frames, subframes, slots, resource blocks (RBs), and OFDM symbols (Figure 1). These elements are the ways to organize the transmission of data across a radio channel in time and frequency domains. To check if the available throughput is enough to connect a point of interest to the internet, this tool uses RBs as the smallest resource units that can be allocated to a user. Each user within a mobile coverage area utilizes RBs to send data. The more users there are within the coverage area, the more data is being transmitted, and the more RBs are being consumed. That\u2019s why the tool uses population density maps to count the number of users within a coverage area and utilizes ITU statistics (Figure 2) on annual mobile traffic consumption to estimate the average traffic consumption for subscribers living within this coverage area. Figure 1: LTE FDD frame structure for 20MHz bandwidth channel ( source ) Figure 2: Mobile-broadband Internet Traffic (within the country), in exabytes per year ( source ) The number of RBs utilized by subscribers also depends on the distance from their location to the cell tower; the farther away they are from towers, the more RBs are required to transmit the same amount of data. This is explained by the fact that signal power decreases with distance (Figure 3). This, in turn, decreases the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR). The lower the SINR, the higher the probability of errors at the receiver side. To reduce the error probability and comply with data transmission standards, user equipment sends channel quality indicator (CQI) information to the base station (Table 1), which is used to choose the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) that defines how many useful bits can be transmitted per Resource Element (RE) and, consequently, per RB, which consists of REs. The better the quality, the higher the MCS, and the more useful data can be transmitted. Conversely, the worse the radio conditions, the lower the MCS, and the less useful data can be transmitted. Therefore, users located far away from the cell tower consume more RBs to transmit the same amount of data: they transmit less data per RB, and more RBs are required to transmit the same amount of data.

The amount of consumed RBs depends on the subscribers' average traffic consumption and their location within the coverage area (Figure 4a). The model makes several simplifications and assumptions. It assumes that the population is equally distributed across the coverage area because, in most cases, there is no data about the antenna sector directions. It breaks down the coverage area into several rings to count the subscribers living within each ring (Figure 4b), using one distance parameter for each ring (Figure 4c) to define the number of consumed RBs for each ring (Figure 5a). Then the model sums up the RB consumptions and subtracts it from the maximum possible RBs for this cell tower. The resulting value is the amount of available RBs that the model uses to compare with the POI throughput requirements (Figure 5b). If the number of RBs (which is defined by the POI throughput requirement and the distance from the cell tower, Figure 5c) required by the POI is less than the number of available RBs, then the capacity is sufficient to connect the POI to the cell tower; it is insufficient otherwise (Figure 5d).

This document provides a high-level overview of the functionalities provided by the RMaLOS class and the methodologies it uses for performing various calculations. Functionalities and Calculations The RMaLOS class offers three core methods, each designed to compute specific aspects of signal strength and quality in rural wireless communication scenarios: 1. Path Loss Calculation ( pathloss ) The pathloss method computes the attenuation of the signal, known as path loss, as it travels from the base station (BS) antenna to the user equipment (UE) transmitter. The factors considered for this computation include: hbs : The height of the BS antenna. hut : The height of the UE transmitter. f : The frequency at which the system operates. d : The distance between the BS and UE. h : The average height of the surrounding buildings. The method employs a specific path loss model tailored for line-of-sight conditions in rural areas. It introduces the concept of a breakpoint distance ( dbp ), which signifies a threshold beyond which the path loss increases at a different rate. Depending on whether the actual distance d is less than or greater than dbp , the method uses one of two formulas ( pl1 or pl2 ) to calculate the path loss. 2. Transmit Power Per Resource Block Calculation ( ptxrb ) The ptxrb method determines the power allocated to each Resource Block (RB), a fundamental frequency allocation unit in LTE systems. The calculation is based on: bw : The total bandwidth available. pnomref : The nominal reference power. The method considers the fixed frequency width of an RB (180 kHz) and adjusts the number of RBs to fit within the specified bandwidth, accounting for guard bands and standardized LTE bandwidth configurations. 3. Maximum Received Power Calculation ( lpmax ) The lpmax method calculates the peak power that the receiver's antenna is capable of receiving. This calculation incorporates: ptxrb : The transmit power per RB. gtx : The gain of the transmitting antenna. grx : The gain of the receiving antenna. pathloss : The path loss as computed by the pathloss method. By adding the transmit power and antenna gains and then subtracting the path loss, the method estimates the power level that would be received at the antenna. Conclusion The RMaLOS class provides essential tools for estimating and optimizing signal propagation in rural wireless networks.
